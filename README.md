# Rage Against Threat Modeling

_"Some of those that work forces,</br>
are the same that burn ~crosses~ 0-days"_

`ratm` is a tool that helps you think about your threat model, generating a static site and graphs that help you navigate them.

It takes its inspiration on [PyTM](https://github.com/OWASP/pytm), but simplifying how things work, by removing dependencies to Java utilities.

This tool actually came out as a way to do the threat modeling of [dangerzone](https://dangerzone.rocks).

## Run the demo

We include a short demo showcasing how to define components, threats, boundaries and scenarios. Here is how to generate a static site out of it:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
uv run demo/model.py | uv run ratm
```
